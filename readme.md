# ðŸš€ Practice Projects

A folder to keep my personal practice projects for learning full stack development.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

- **todo-app** â†’ Full stack todo app with frontend and backend

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Each project has its own frontend and backend folder
- Iâ€™m deploying frontend on **Vercel** and backend on **Render**
- `.gitignore` used to ignore `node_modules`, `.env`, and `dist`

---

## ðŸ“– Deployment Steps (for myself)

1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "your message"`
3. `git push`
4. Deploy frontend on **Vercel**
5. Deploy backend on **Render**

Thatâ€™s it âœ…
